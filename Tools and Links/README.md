### E-Paper Display
[This is the one I used](https://www.waveshare.com/product/displays/e-paper/epaper-1/5.83inch-e-paper.htm), but any display from Waveshare will work, but modifications to code required. I can only test this display, so can only guarantee that it'll work with this one, but I can't see why it wouldn't work.
